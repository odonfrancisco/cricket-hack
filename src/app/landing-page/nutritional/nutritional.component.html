    Cricket flour is valued because it is gluten-free and high in protein. The benefits of eating more high protein
    foods include improved muscle mass, weight management, stabilized blood sugar levels, improved mood, healthy brain
    and heart function, and slower aging.

    Cricket protein powder is also a good source of iron and calcium. Iron-rich foods provide energy, boost muscle
    function and promote brain function. Consuming enough iron is also very important for women who are pregnant.
    Calcium-rich foods help to reduce blood pressure, promote bone health, support weight management and may even
    decrease the risk or colon and rectal cancers. <br><br>
    A serving of cricket powder is two tablespoons (12 grams) and contains about:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>

      <li> 55 calories</li>
      <li> 0.8 grams carbohydrates</li>
      <li> 7 grams of protein</li>
      <li> 2 grams of fat</li>
      <li> 4 percent DV iron</li>
      <li> 2 percent DV calcium</li>
      <li> 17 percent DV vitamin B12</li>
      <li> 23 percent DV vitamin B2</li>

  <h2> <b> Cricket protein vs. Beef and Other Protein Sources</b> </h2><br>
  <h5>
    <ul>

      <li>By dry weight, a single cricket ranges between 65–70 percent pure protein, while beef is only 17–40
        percent
        protein.</li><br>

      <li>A 200 calorie serving of cricket flour contains about 31 grams of protein, 8 grams of fat, 1.8 grams
        omega-3,
        7
        grams fiber.</li><br>

      <li>A 200 calorie serving of beef contains about 22.4 grams protein, 11 grams of fat, 0.04 grams omega-3, 0
        grams
        fiber.</li><br>

      <li>A 200 calorie serving of eggs contains about 19 grams protein, 15 grams of fat, 0.1 grams omega-3, 0
        grams
        fiber.</li><br>

      <li>To get one pound of protein, about 2,500 gallons of water is required for cattle, 800 gallons for pigs,
        567
        for
        chickens and 1 gallon for crickets.</li><br>

      <li><b>Crickets require about 6 times less feeding than cattle, 4 times less than sheep and 2 times less
          than
          pigs to
          produce the same amount of protein.</b></li><br>

    <h2> Sustainability</h2>
  </b>
  <h5>Cricket flour is emerging as a new source of protein for athletes and people who are looking for a more
    sustainable option. Crickets offer an ethically viable option for people who want to decrease red meat intake
    but
    need protien, and want to have sustianable food source in a well balanced diversified food source.</h5>
